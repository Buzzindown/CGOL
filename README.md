# Conway's Game of Life, Interactive Simulator
The purpose of this project is to create an easy, quick way for\
educators and creators to make specific game of life layouts.\
The website provides a grid on which creators can lay out their designs.\
The simulator can then be run, allowing the creator to observe\
how the simulations reacts to their creation.

Previously, I built this with vanilla JavaScript/CSS/HTML but have since
decided to remake it in React. Development is still in progress but the current
version is functioning well on desktop.
