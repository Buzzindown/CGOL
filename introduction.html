         <h1 align="center" >What is John Conway's Game of life?</h1>
         <p>The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, or Conway's Game of Life  (CGOL) is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
            It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with
            the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal
            constructor or any other Turing machine.
         </p>
         <h1 align="center" >Rules of the Game</h1>
         <p>The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two
            possible states, live or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which
            are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
         </p>
         <ol>
            <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
            <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>
         <p>These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:</p>
         <ol>
         <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.</li>
         <li>Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.</li>
         <li>All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.</li>
         </ol
         <p>The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to
            every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick.
            Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

         <h1 align="center" >Features of the Simulator </h1>
         <ul>
            <li>Cell age indicated via color</li>
            <ul>
               <li> Cells will change color every generation depending on how long they have been alive for. Freshly born cells will appear turqoise and fade into
                  white as their age increases each generation. Grey cells represent freshly dead cells, which fade into black the longer they remain dead.
            </ul>
            <li>Changeable grid size.</li>
            <ul>
               <li> Grid size is capped at 86 x 58 in order to maintain framerate</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Create alive / dead cells using a "brush".</li>
            <li>Increase or decrease the time that each generation takes to tick.</li>
            <li>Dynamically change the brush size. </li>
            <li>Reset the grid for a fresh start. </li>

         How to Use the Interactive Simulator
         <h1>
         <h2 align="center" > Changing the Grid Size </h2>
         <p> First things first. Before you are able to create your simulation, you must adjust the grid size to your liking. Once you have
            selected an appropriate grid size, click on "LOCK GRID SIZE" to confirm your selection. You can now draw your cells on the grid.
         </p>
         <h2 align="center" > Drawing Cells </h2>
         <p>
            The key part of this simulator is the ability to draw and erase cells as you see fit. In order to be able to draw, the grid
            size must be locked in, as mentioned above. You can only draw during the create stage which is indicated at the top of the page.
            This "stage" can be toggled using the "START/STOP" button, which upon clicking will pause the simulation allowing you to add
            new cells. You can change from drawing live cells to drawing dead cells (erasing) using the "DRAW/ERASE" button to toggle between the two.
            Brush size can be changed whenever using the range slider "Brush Size".
         </p>
         <h2 align="center" > Starting the Simulation </h2>
         <p>Now that you have your simulation setup, click the "START/STOP" button to start the simulation. The generation count is Indicated
            on the right side of the page. The time that a generation takes to complete can be adjusted using the "Generation Speed" slider.
         </p>
         <h2 align="center" > Grid On/Off </h2>
         <p> The grid overlay can be toggled on and off using the "GRID ON/OFF" button.</p>
         <h2 align="center" > Resetting the Grid </h2>
         <p> You can reset the grid at anytime by pressing the "RESET GRID" button. Pressing the button will clear all live cells from the grid.</p>
